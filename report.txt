I first started reading about the mapreduce itself and its relation to Apache hadoop. Then I read documents about hadoop and its distributed file system (HDFS). Since I am already familiar with Linux and Java I only needed to learn aboud hadoop.
At first I tested the java compiler on the server. I wrote a simple java program and uploaded it to server, compiled it and run it.
Then I tried to run the wordcount example. I used this tutorial:
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html

I uploaded the source for "Example: WordCount v1.0" to the server and compile and run it with these commands:

// to set path for tools.jar
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$JDK_HOME/lib/tools.jar

// to compile the source code
hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main WordCount.java

// to generate jar file from compile .class files
jar cf wc.jar WordCount*.class

// and finally to run hadoop
hadoop jar wc.jar WordCount input.txt output

before that I created input.txt with some words in it and copied it to the hadoop file system.

hadoop fs -put ./input.txt ./

And then we can see the file:
hadoop fs -ls

Then I started to change the code to have the simplified version of the project.
I didn't change the class names and other things, that's why they are still named for the wordcount example.
The reducer function is pretty much the same, I only had to write map function.
My code looks self explanatory. There are 8 nested for loops to generate all the possible motifs.
then I scan the line to find min_dist for that motif. And finally I write the result which is min_dist for that motif on that line to the context object.
The reducer will add them all together to find the total distance for each motif.
For the simpified version map values are just simple integers.

But for the full version of the problem I had to create my own structure to use it as map values.
It has 4 elements. score, seq_id, start_index and candidate.
It must "implement Writable".
Then in the mapper instead of writing a simple integer I write an instance of my structure.
score is the same as min_dist, seq_id is the line number (from key in map function), start_index is where in that line that I found the candidate with min_dist.
Then the reducer function will again add all the scores together to find the total distance.

In this project I became familiar with mapreduce and hadoop.

I really don't know what else to add. If you need any further explanation please let me know.
Thank you.
